## 事件总结及响应

(this is mostly for the benefit of attendees to get them caught up quickly - this doesn't need to be read aloud or something)

`fractureiser` is a novel self replicating virus that infects Bukkit plugins, Forge Mods, Fabric Mods, and vanilla Minecraft JARs. Infected JARs, upon being loaded, will run as normal, but silently download a series of payloads that steal login tokens, stored browser passwords/payment information, and cryptocurrency. After a computer has been infected, every applicable JAR file on the compromised system will be infected such that if they are shared and run on an another computer, the infection will spread. Compromised Curseforge login tokens were used to gain access to large mod projects and distribute infected JARs to users.

Discussion and responses to the issue began in earnest on June 6th. Samples were gradually discovered, identified, and decompiled. The source of the payloads that propogate the malware and steal passwords/tokens was identified, and swiftly taken down by its host, Serverion. Infected JARs are no longer able to progress or propogate the malware, but infections from prior to the node being taken down may still be active.

At time of writing, samples continue to be reverse engineered in the hopes that, should the attackers attempt to create a new iteration of the malware, its command and control nodes can be taken down as quickly as possible. On June 7th, the attacker attempted to create a new node, which was again swiftly taken down by its host. A web URL pointing to this now-defunct node has been found, and is being actively monitored.

## 日程安排

我们有大约一小时的时间，所以我建议我们每个话题只花最多 15 分钟。
我已按我（williewillus）所认为的可行性从高到低将话题排列如下。
越是不可能实现的项目越靠后。如果时间有限，我们还可能会放弃某些话题。

### 审核流程不透明 /「隐晦式安全」

#### 讨论及行动事项

- CurseForge/Modrinth 在审核模组的时候**到底做了什么**？
  - 此处应有「what do you do here」表情包（笑）
- 哪些检查**是自动的**？
  - ?
- 哪些自动检查**应该有**？
  - 静态分析？
  - 我们能说服模组仓库在这方面发力吗？
- 半跑题：我们能说服 CurseForge 换一个不是 MD5 的散列码算法吗？MD5 已经被攻破数年了，再这样等下去我们迟早有一天会等来针对 CurseForge 上模组的碰撞攻击。
  - Modrinth 在用什么？

纪要：

Fury: CEO of overwolf. Eng is working on mitigations, so I'm here  
	Re: checks. From a high-level perspective. Don't want to be too open about the checks  
	because people can find ways to bypass. Understand that the ambiguity is a concern,  
	will share as much as I can.  
	All mods have auto checks. Manual checks for some.  
	Technically, start by running antivirus/antimalware scans. Check file type/adherence to file structure.  
	API actually supports SHA-1.  
	More clientside improvements to enforce this in a good way.  
	Manual checks when an auto check flags it, human reviews the mod. Changing text/images also involves manual review.  
	Continuously evolving process, have updated automated tests to look for this vuln.  
	
Emi: Moving to modrinth to keep things quick

Geo/Jay: Founder of Modrinth. Our moderation is pretty robust.
	New project: manual review. Check description, images. Also check the source code, esp. for new/unknown authors.
	Closed source, will occasionally decompile mods, but not often.
	Checks on backend for file structure.
	Malware in modded mc is generally never detected by antivirus.
	Have rejected mods in the past for suspicious code.
	Understand this process is flawed. After initial review, we rely on reports afterwards.
	Our code is open source, we want a transparent tool the community can use.
	Relies on community trust (known author), but this is also flawed.
	
Emi: When you check open source mods, do you verify the source corresponds to the jar?

Geo: No, but we could do something where users can upload the source for a verified badge,
like what npm has recently does. Might not be most ideal.

Emi: Which hash is used by Modrinth

Geo: We use SHA-1/SHA-512. Avaiable in API. Launcher we're building validates
them. Rehashed all files in SHA-512 a year ago.



### 可重现构建（Reproducible Build）

实现「扫描被窜改后的模组」这个需求的一大挑战是「确保某一个特定版本的模组只可能有一种编译结果」。
换言之，我们需要实现模组源码的可重现构建。如此一来，我们只需要重新从源码构建模组，并将其哈希值与可疑文件比对，
就可以排除掉阶段 0 的感染，而不必绕路去拿着特征码比对 jar 文件中的所有内容。

有多少模组的构建脚本里指定了版本号带 `-SNAPSHOT` 的插件和前置库？

我打赌是所有，因为[Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod/blob/1.20/build.gradle#L2)和
[Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/blob/1.19.x/mdk/build.gradle#L4)的模板仓库都有类似操作。

诸如 Loom 和 FG 这样的插件一直都有使用动态版本号的传统，其出发点则是在不需要用户介入的情况下推送新版修复，然而现在 Auditability（可审计性？）成为了首要需求。

从被黑的模组开发相关 Maven 仓库发起的供应链攻击，现在来看，是真实存在的安全威胁。

#### 讨论及行动事项

- 停止在示例项目里宣传 `-SNAPSHOT` 的使用，鼓励使用固定版本号
- 更新 fabric-example-mod 及 forge MDK 示例项目，加入 Gradle checksum verification 及 locking 的用例？
  - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_verification.html
    - 这是传统意义上的「把文件 hash 保存起来以供检查」的 lockfile 策略
  - https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_locking.html
    - 这是「把形如 `[1, 2)` 的带范围版本号声明锁死在某一特定版本，直至用户主动要求更新」的策略
- 在 Loom/FG 中成立工作小组，调研如何在[启用 Gradle 的 可重现构建](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/working_with_files.html#sec:reproducible_archives)后成功实现可重现构建。
  目前，模组开发工具链中存在诸如 jar 重混淆之类的不确定性（non-determinism）。
  这些不确定性都应该尽力消除，以确保我们可以有开箱即用的可重现构建。
- 未曾设想的道路：走 F-Droid 风格，直接提交源码，由平台负责构建？
  - 考虑其成本，不太可能实现。

Starchild: For Quilt, one issue here is signing. We can't reproduce a signature.

willie: But if the signature is distributed separately, should be fine?

Geo: We can never be 100% secure. We can spend a lot of time reviewing every file.  One
important thing is accessibility. Many people don't know how Gradle works/what
reproducible builds are. Template mods exist, but even code signing is hard for mobile devs.
We get thousands of submissions a day.

Fury: One thing we suggest, for authors that opt to go through extra verification have a
tag on their mod for gamers to see to increase trust.

### 从外部下载文件的模组

从外部下载含有可执行代码文件的模组，均会受到供应链攻击的威胁。

一些会这么做的行为的模组案例：

- [Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/essential)
  - 内置自动更新器，会不经用户提示更新模组。
    若 Essential 服务器被攻破，攻击者可透过其将代码下发至客户端。
- 依赖 [owolib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib) 的模组，例如 [gadget](https://modrinth.com/mod/gadget)
  - 会提示用户需要下载 owo-lib，用户同意后会从 Modrinth 下载文件。
    若攻击者在 Modrinth 上传了版本正确的模组，将构成供应链攻击。
  
只要有一个热门模组，比如 Essential，的服务器被攻破，恶意软件就可以在短时间内影响数百万用户。

#### 讨论及行动事项

- 上传至专门的平台（Modrinth、CurseForge 等）的模组是否应允许包含「从外部下载可执行代码」的代码？
  - 我认为应该禁止，但我们如何强制执行这一点？启动游戏并检查其是否会往 `mods` 文件夹里下载文件？

Fury: Manually review when we see this pattern happen

willie: But you can push malicious code later

Fury: look at the author's reputation and other attributes of safety.

Starchild: Not too down to ban downloading everything from the internet. See some
legitimate usecases. We can mark the mod on the platform as downloading external code.
Can have policies like must do over https, etc. We can draft it in the community.

willie: Clarification: I mean talking about downloading code, not data

Lambda: TODO(willie i missed first half) Quilt had a proposal to do dependency
downloading.  More generally, only allow downloading of things that were predeclared
(e.g. with a hash). Even if we allow mods that do this, I will still stay suspicious.

### 代码签名

模组作者应为他们发布的二进制文件签名。

Fabric Loom、ForgeGradle 等工具链应提供足够多的关于下列主题的文档以及模板，以最大限度保证用户体验；

- 如何在 CI 中构建模组
- 如何在 CI 中为模组签名
- 如何在 CI 中将签名后的模组自动发布到模组仓库中

使用 CI 构建这件事本身就已经超出了绝大多数模组开发者的能力范围（大多数模组开发者甚至都不会给新版发布打标签）。
请记住，很多模组开发者都只是编程爱好者，从未有过在业界工作的经验，很可能对上述概念一无所知。

我实在无法再继续强调「文档完整、简单易学、开箱即用」这几个事有多重要了。做不到的话，那只有一个结果：没有人用。

我们的最终目标应当是要求每一次上传都应有有效签名，签名无效或缺失者直接拒绝。为此，我们需要一段时间过渡期，
并且需要有人编写合适的教材。

#### 讨论及行动事项

- Where should public keys be held and associated with their authors? In other words, what
  prevents a hacker from replacing a public key as well as the signed binary at the same
  time?
  - In the modrinth user account (behind 2fa)?
    - Without organization accounts this can be annoying for mods that can be uploaded by
      multiple people?
    - If Modrinth is compromised a hacker can replace the pubkey and uploade a new signed
      binary at the same time
- PGP signing or java jarsigner stuff?
  - PGP is the standard and used for Maven Central. My impression is no one uses the java
    specific stuff. OpenSSH signing is also an option but is much newer and has no
    established ecosystem. PGP is probably the best choice, unfortunately. We can automate
    away all the crappy parts of it with helpers in Gradle plugins.
- Prior art
  - Forge has had support for signature stuff for years and it's gone unused. What can we
    learn from it?
- Launchers should likely include UI elements to indicate mod signature verification status.
- Immediate followups
  - Modrinth and CurseForge design how public key association/storage will work
  - Mod loaders write extensive documentation about how to:
    1. Create releases in CI using git tags
    2. Automatically sign and upload artifacts from CI

Emi: this doesn't necessitate a required process

Starchild: What do we want to prevent here and where? Mod repo can just associate a key
with the user and require it in upload, but enforcement/verification can also happen in
the loader.

Jasmine: I recently uploaded to Maven Central which enforces code signing. Process was
mostly painless via buildscripts, hardest part was finding the docs.

Emi: Relaying from text chat, what is the point of signing? The main reason is for
identifying actors.

cpw: Wrote codesigning for Forge, been there around 10y. It might have detected stage0 and
probably stage3 if the signature wasn't stripped. We've wanted people to do it. Most
people in Forge use it these days. Fingerprints for signatures show up in debug logs,
etc. That's the primary purpose. IMO needs to be pushed a layer up. There is no mechanism
to distribute trust. A modder can tell their *own* jar is good, but the user doesn't. That
requires a trust authority in the mc ecosystem. Setting one is a complex endeavour. Only
viable actor is CF and Modrinth, since they already track the stuff you need to track. +1
on badging on the mod repos. Doing it on the clientside? We're far too late for that at
the moment. If the entire ecosystem was signed, we could revisit.

Emi: Is it possible to have a collaboratively controlled third party CA? Adding two steps
is a bit much.

cpw: You can sign with multiple CA's at once, so that isn't necessary

Fury: We can look into it.

cpw: If you're committing to it, that's awesome :)

Geo: IMO would be best if a trusted third party does it. Diff platforms have diff
policies. Modrinth interested in this as well, but we have to move carefully. 

Emi: Are you willing to work with CurseForge for a third party CA?

Geo: Yeah. Everyone should put their differences aside for security, even though Modrinth
wasn't affected it still was indirectly since "

cpw: Would be nice to see movement after 10y

### 沙箱

Sandboxing the Minecraft process is another defense strategy that can be used to limit the
blast radius of attacks coming from malicious mod code.

In general, it's a hard problem.

Minecraft should only need access to:

- The internet, to authenticate, log into servers, etc.
- Filesystem access to the `.minecraft` instance folder and its recursive descendants

The main thing of interest to lock down here is filesystem access.

On Windows, there does not seem to be any simple to deploy sandboxing system (besides
"play bedrock"). The closest is Chromium's
[model](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/design/sandbox.md)
which would require significant invasive changes to the game.

On macOS, we *could* use Apple's built in sandboxing system known as ["Seatbelt"](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox/osx-sandboxing-design/). It is already enforced in apple's app store, but not external apps like Minecraft. However it is still not possible to use it to restrict network access to certain sites.
Below is a image which shows its file permission config which we can use to restrict its access. This could prove to be good enough for what is needed to limit malware and attacks from the code.
![image](media/sandboxfile.png)


On Linux, we have a couple options. First is SELinux/AppArmor. These frameworks are
infamous for being insanely hard to configure and as a result have not been widely
deployed. However, the policies we seek are quite simple, so it's possible this could be
an avenue.

In OpenBSD parlance, all we want to do is [`unveil(2)`](https://man.openbsd.org/unveil) to
all paths in the instance root, but unfortunately this interface isn't available in Linux.

Second, is using a system such as Flatpak.


timoreo: Executing untrusted code is always unsafe, regardless of what sandboxing you
have. Sandboxing is always your last resort. We have a flatpak of Prism which is sandboxed
and restricts a lot of access. Prevented this specific attack. Can be difficult, e.g. you
might think you can restrict mic, but what if a mod adding voice chat wants it? Needs to
be restricted but allow freedom for modders. Linux has a lot of techniques, can restrict
pretty much everything.

ZekeZ: Main issue is Windows and macOS, especially Windows.

Emi: Concern for several mods. Locking down fs access can be problematic for mods that
want global instance-independent configs

ZekeZ: What was the problem with EMI?

Emi: There is a user-facing option to store stuff in ~/.minecraft instead of the instance
local one

timoreo: You can case-by-case allow files. Anyways, what about network?

Recap

kennytv: Hi from Paper. Some overlap with modding, and have our own plugin repo. Would be
interested in one maintainable scanner for identifying current malware. There is a bunch
right now. On signing, Sponge also had that for a while. They basically gave on it,
because people didn't know how to use it. Very hard to get novices to understand it.

Lambda: Would like to see mod hosting to add more 2FA. Or even only allowing API/CI to
upload. That can be a bit annoying but can avoid token stealing resulting in bad
uploads. Currently don't know if Modrinth has 2fa. CurseForge has it but only for
payouts. Want to see this expanded.

Geo: Were working on 2fa before this started. Will also allow scoped tokens (e.g. unsigned
builds only from this token, signed builds only from this token) 2fa has a flaw which is
your session token is still vulnerable to compromise. LTT YouTube was compromised by
this. Planning on launching new auth stuff in a couple of weeks.

Emi: To point out, LPS authors did have 2fa.

willie: Reiterating the point about building, signing, releasing **in CI**

Geo: one thing platforms to do is a general checklist when they're first uploading a
project. On Modrinth we have a guide for literally everything. When we added descriptions
and icons to the new upload checklist, rates of doing so jumped up.

Emi: Recently implemented CI publishing. Just copied another Github workflow file. This
isn't maintainable.

Lambda: CI is not a thing a first time modder will do. There's a learning curve to
modding: experimentation, then publishing, then fix stuff after you get popular. It's very
daunting for a beginner due to lack of documentation *for modding workflows*. CI not
really in the example mod templates.

Jared: Host the BlameJared maven with lots of projects. Encourage people to use CI as much
as possible. Default MDK just publishes artifact, not even source. Need more examples and
guides to set up jenkins, etc.

willie: GH Actions is probably easier for beginners than Jenkins no?

Jared: Not familiar with GH does it now. All files on my maven are built locally, not sure
how remote publishing would work.

Emi: For a lot of mods, Maven is not strictly necessary. Can use CurseMaven/Modrinth's
maven. Useful for mods that don't intentionally expose themselves as API's.

willie: +1 that Maven's are second order, most mods are leaf content mods that don't need
Maven publishing.

Jared: CurseMaven is not a long term option. No one noticed, but CurseGradle has been
taken off Github. Its source is gone. Nobody has noticed or spoken up about it.

willie: overall action item recap

Fury: Thanks everyone. Overwolf has grown over the years. Some folks reached out and
provided valuable information. If you have further information, feel free to contact us it
would help a lot.
